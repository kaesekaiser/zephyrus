A Discord bot in Python 3.9 that performs a weird bunch of random functions, with a particular focus on those useful to conlanging + conlangers. I started working on this project on 22 January 2018, but I waited nearly a year to make this repository. I run it from a Raspberry Pi in my bedroom. Code is in the ./bot directory.
