A miscellaneous-use Discord bot in Python 3.11. I started working on this project on 22 January 2018, though I waited nearly a year to make this repository. In the past, I ran the bot from a Raspberry Pi 3 in my bedroom, but on 1 November 2023, I switched to a cloud-based distribution platform. Code is in the ./bot directory.
