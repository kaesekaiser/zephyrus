# zephyrus
NOTE - At the turn of the year, I started switching to a different branch of the discord.py module, and I used it as an excuse to rewrite a lot of gross, shoddy code. I'm still in the process of doing that, so several commands that were _once_ on Zephyrus, currently aren't. Source code for all those can be found in the ``old`` branch of this repository.

A Discord bot that performs a weird bunch of random functions. I started working on this project on 22 January 2018, but I waited nearly a year to make this repository. I run it from a Raspberry Pi in my bedroom. Code is in the ./bot directory.
