# WHY NEW ZEPH?

Due to an error on Discord's end, I'm unable to get Zephyrus verified, which means he can't join more than 100 servers. To fix this, I'm setting up a second, fresh bot, which will ideally *not* get falsely flagged, and thus *will* eventually get verified. This second bot - which I'm ingeniously calling 2ephyrus - will function identically to the original Zephyrus.

## WHAT HAPPENED?

Long story short, Zephyrus has been falsely flagged as "inorganically grown", implying that I've artificially inflated his server count to hit the verification criterion, and my talks with Discord staff to remove this flag have been... unproductive, to say the least. This flag prevents verification (the little checkmark you see next to the `BOT` logo), and verification is required in order for a bot to join more than 100 servers. Zephyrus is currently at this limit, so he can't go anywhere new without first leaving an existing server. Years of hard work down the drain... unless I just make a new one.

## WHAT'S CHANGING?

Absolutely nothing but the username. As long as you add 2ephyrus to your server before the changeover date, **all data, settings, etc. will carry over automatically**.

## WHAT DO I DO?

All you need to do is add 2ephyrus to whatever server(s) you have Zephyrus in. You can do this with the following invite link:

On **November 1st, 2023**, I'll stop running the original Zephyrus, and switch over to the brand new 2ephyrus. Note that this means Zeph 1.0 **will go dark** on November 1st, 2023. This link will still be accessible from his About Me section. If you're reading this in the future, that's why Zephyrus don't work no more.
